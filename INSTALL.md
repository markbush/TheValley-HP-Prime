## Installing and Upgrading The Valley

The application has been packaged into a [ZIP file](TheValley-HPP.zip) which you should download and unpack.  Move the unpacked `The Valley.hpappdir` folder into the `Content` folder in your installation of the HP Connectivity Kit.

If you have downloaded this entire repository, then you will find that the ZIP file is already unpacked.

# First Time Install

If this is the first time you have installed this application, connect your calculator to the HP Connectivity Kit and drag `The Valley.hpappdir` in.

# Upgrading

If you already have `The Valley` installed, then connect your calculator to the HP Connectivity Kit and open up the `files` folder in the installed version.  Copy any player files that you want to keep out and put them into the newly unpacked `The Valley.hpappdir` folder.  Now, you can move the new version of the app over without fear of losing your saved characters.
