This is a port of "The Valley" game to the HP Prime calculator.  It was developed and tested on a "G2" model and I cannot guarantee that it will run correctly on an earlier version.

The original version was printed as a program listing in the [April 1982](http://www.flaxcottage.com/ComputingToday/8204.pdf) edition of [Computing Today](http://www.flaxcottage.com/ComputingToday/) magazine for the Commodore PET.

The game appeared on a number of other systems over the years, such as the VIC-20, C-64, Spectrum, etc and I figured the HP Prime, with its 320x240 display, would be an ideal target.

Here you will find:
* The original [back-story](STORY.md) from the magazine.
* [Installation/upgrade](INSTALL.md) instructions.
* How to [play](PLAY.md) the game.
* An [explanation](CODE.md) of how the parts of the program work with hints at how it could be extended.
